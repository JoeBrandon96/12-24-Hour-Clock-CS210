# 12-24-Hour-Clock-CS210
A program that prints a 12- and 24 hour clock simultaneously (currently non-functioning)

This project functions solely as a console program that prints a 12 hour clock and a 24 hours clock simultaneously, while also printing a menu that, when 1-4 is entered, will perform one of four different actions. One will add one second, one will add one minute, one will add one hour and the 4th option will exit the program.

I feel as though I definitely did particularly well in writing the clock display and menu display. It was fairly easy and if I so choose, I feel as though I can improve upon it in so many different ways due to the ease of updating the functions of the program.

I believe I can enhance my code in many different ways. For starters, I can add new functionality to the clocks, making them tick and perhaps even conform to the local time zone as well, depending on the user's location. I can also certainly improve the program entirely, possibly using a new framework, creating a window to display two physical analog/digital clocks side by side.

I honestly thought that the AM/PM function was the most difficult to implement. Not because it was difficult to write, but because I kept hitting walls and errors in the program and took me an hour or so to figure out the bugs I had written.

I can certainly pull my skills at writing functions and utilize them in future projects. It seems to be not just the easiest to manipulate and improve on over time, but the most fun to implement as well.

I made this program easily maintainable and adaptable by creating plenty of functions that are more or less open-ended and can be easily improved by adding new functionality. I made it readable as well by not cluttering my code with overwritten lines of code and implementing functions that are used within very few lines of code in the main.
